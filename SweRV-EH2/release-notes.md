# EH2 SweRV RISC-V Core<sup>TM</sup> 1.4 from Western Digital

* Clock gating bug fixes
* Corner case bug fix for running hart PIC store colliding with debugger PIC access
* Bug fix for debugger seeing error from DMA access
* Fixed bug with BFP not matching updated 0.94 bitmanip spec
* Branch predictor - fixed used bits for multihit case
* Fixed bug with corner case incorrect clearing of reservation when faulting DCCM 
  stores align with DCCM DMA accesses



# EH2 SweRV RISC-V Core<sup>TM</sup> 1.3 from Western Digital

* Multiple debug module compliance deviations and bugs reported by Codasip
* Updates to debug module to level compliance to version 0.13.2 of debug spec
* Trigger chaining compliance fixes
* Power optimization improvements and clock gating improvements
    * Significantly lower power in sleep as well as normal operation.
* Enhanced debug memory abstract command to access internal as well as external memories
* Added bit-manipulation support for Zba, Zbb, Zbc, Zbe, Zbf, Zbp, Zbr, Zbs `0.94` draft spec.
    * Zba, Zbb, Zbc and Zbs are enabled by default. Use `-set=bitmanip_zb*=1` to enable other sub-extensions.
* Enhancements and additional configurations options for a faster divider
* JTAG controller intial state issue fixed
* Branch predictor fully-associative mode for 8,16,32 entries.
* Branch predictor SRAM  btb for BTB size > 256
* Corner case bugs fixes related to 
    * Bus protocol corner cases (ahb)
    * Fetch bus error recording improved accuracy
    * Branch predictor pathological timing cases fixes
    * Fast interrupt with DCCM ECC errors priority bug
    * MPC & PMU protocol cleanup
    * Timeout due to branch-error and icache parity error collision
    * Cross-thread fwd progress denial pathological cases
    * DMA/DCCM data corruption path for address 0x0

* Demo test-bench updates
    * Handling bigger test sizes using associative arrays in external memory slaves, 
    * simplified test building process and CCM loading functions (only program.hex is generated, no data.hex)
    * Improved Makefile and example tests (see README)
    * Generating link.ld from swerv.config
    

# EH2 SweRV RISC-V Core<sup>TM</sup> 1.2 from Western Digital

## Release Notes

* Modified MSCAUSE encoding to be consistent with current internal specification
* Added internal timers


# EH2 SweRV RISC-V Core<sup>TM</sup> 1.1 from Western Digital

## Release Notes

* Several bug fixes in debug module
    * Added new `dbg_rst_l` input for system wide reset to debug module. If debug module operation during core reset is not needed, this can be connected to `rst_l`.
* Demo testbench has a synthesizable bridge to allow accessing the ICCM with load/stores via the DMA port. (*This only works with the AXI4 build*)
